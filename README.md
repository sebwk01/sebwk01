## Greetings

I am currently working with the company I co-founded in 2020, Company of Things, where I primarily use TypeScript to work with:
- Front-end:
  - Vue/Vuetify
  - Tailwind
- Back-end:
  - Node.js
  - Nuxt
  - MongoDB/Mongoose
- Protocols:
  - uWebSocket
  - HTTPS

During my 5 year Master's degree program in Electronical System Design, which I finished in the summer of 2025, I have also worked a lot with:
- Python
- C
- LaTeX
